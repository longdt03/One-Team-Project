### About One Remote Program
----------------------------------------------------------------------
One Remote Program is an application for mobile devices to remotely control computer
It is a open source code so feel free to download it and use it if u want
This client program has been written in ionic framework and we have used firebase API to store and sync the data. The programming language we use is angularjs 
In this server, we have used java to code all necessary functions.  
Besides, we have used [jshint tool](http://jshint.com/) to check and test the syntax. So, don't worry about any syntax error.
